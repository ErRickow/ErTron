## Welcome to tron

Everything that you want to know about tron is here.

### Introduction

Currently there is only one person working on this project, ofc that's me ! I started this project in December 29, 2020. 
Its a small project for educational purpose + timepass, it is based on python language with pyrogram library, i am just a beginner in this field so the updates of this userbot must be slow and small.


### Features & bot information

So i am not dividing my updates in different versions of my Userbots, because its incomplete and there are so many changes i do in bots every day so giving updates information and and assigning versions to my Userbot is not good right now.
Tron is built with two clients, one is the main userbot and second one is the assistant, i have added some modules for tronuserbot and plugins for assistant.
I have provided a inline help menu to make it easy for the beginners to look for plugins and commands.


### Deployment

Tue userbot can be deployed in railway or heroku, both deployments have little bugs right now, we'll solve those as soon as possible.
